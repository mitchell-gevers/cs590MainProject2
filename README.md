# cs590MainProject

This project uses the Flickr api and displays pictures of cats and dogs.  The site uses local storage to save the users name, and whether they prefer to sort by oldest or youngest photos.  CSS is used to make it more mobile friendly.  

issues:
- only tested in chrome
- Flickr API key sometimes expires, and uses a global variable for easier replacement
- use of global variables like this is bad practice and bothers me, i just don’t have enough time to fix it
-website background has the word “background” written on it because i just took the image from google

how to run:
-after downloading, click on the index.html file and open with chrome
